# Firearm Suicide Rates in the U.S.

This project aims to investigate the firearm suicide rates in the United States during the period between 2010 and 2020. The study includes analyzing the differences in suicide rates with and without the use of firearms, studying the rates of gun owners who committed suicide, and estimating the sales of firearms during the specified timeframe.


## Data Process

- Dataset for number of gun owners was collected from BuzzFeed News Github.
- Collected information on suicide rates using a firearm through a Kaggle dataset. 
- See references section to see orginal datasets. 

#### How was the data used?

- Background checks were used for number of gun owners. 
- Sales were estimated by background checks for each firearm type. 
- Long gun, handgun, and other = 1 sale; multiple = 2 sales.
